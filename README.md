# kapetn-api-go

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Go package. A short
introduction of this package could easily go here.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.
* [Go](https://golang.org/): any one of the **three latest major**
  [releases](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html)

## Installation

With [Go module](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) support (Go 1.11+),
simply add the following import

```go
import "github.com/kapeten/kapetn-api-go/metadata" // Replace with the package you want to use.
```

to your code, and then `go [build|run|test]` will automatically fetch the
necessary dependencies.

Otherwise, to install the `kapetn-api-go` package, run the following command:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/kapeten/kapetn-go/metadata # Replace with the package you want to use.
```

Most packages have their own module, so it is best to `go get` the packages you
require explicitly.
